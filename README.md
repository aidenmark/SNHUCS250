Software Development Lifecycle

Sprint Review and Retrospective

1.  How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret the needs of the user, you must first identify what the requirements of the program are to ensure that the user’s needs are met.  This can be completed through the use of user stories.  These stories can come from research such as feedback from users or performing focus groups to have an open discussion with users about the things they would like to see.

2.  How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

During this course, I learned to approach developing programs through an agile approach.  I found that the agile approach provided structure and organization.  It allowed for me to explicitly define roles and task for each member of the team.  In the future I hope to still use this approach when appropriate.  I think this approach instills collaboration and open communication, which are two key factors for a successful project.  

3.  What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good member in software development is to create an environment where others feel confident their ideas will be heard and not judged.  I also think creating an environment that fosters open and constant communication is key.  I think it is also important to have daily touch bases with your immediate team to recap the previous days work and to outline the plan for the day.
